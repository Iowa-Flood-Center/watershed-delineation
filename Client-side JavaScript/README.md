## Watershed.js
This JavaScript implementation provides a working web app that uses client resources to delineate watersheds.

### Usage
`instant_watershed(x, y)` takes two parameters and data is being read from a png file named `input.png`.  
x: x indice of the target point  
y: y indice of the target point  
When this function is ran, the border is being saved to the `border` array.

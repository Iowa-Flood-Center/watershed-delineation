## Watershed.wasm
This WebAssembly version is generated by feeding the C implementation to the emscripten compiler. This implementation provides a proof of concept fast client-side watershed delineation tool with lower level web technologies.

### Compilation
Compilation was done using emscripten version `1.38.20`.  
Following command was ran,  
`emcc  -o wasm.html watershed.c -O3 -s WASM=1 --shell-file html_template/shell_minimal.html -s EXTRA_EXPORTED_RUNTIME_METHODS="['cwrap', 'getValue']" -s "EXPORTED_FUNCTIONS=['_malloc', '_free']" -s TOTAL_MEMORY=200MB` Recall that when data size increases the TOTAL_MEMORY option specified in this command also subject to change. If you will compile your own version of this implementation, remember to import `wasm_ws.js` that wraps WASM implementation to the usage manual below.

### Usage
`instant_watershed(x, y)` takes two parameters and data is being read from a png file named `input.png`.  
x: x indice of the target point  
y: y indice of the target point  
When this function is ran, the border is being saved to the `border` array.
